# led-mapping-system

## Coordinate System Management (/public/js/deviceManager.js)
- LED positioning algorithms for spatial mapping
- Coordinate transformation system for multiple layout types
- Template-based LED layout generation supporting:
  * Linear arrays
  * Grid configurations 
  * Circular formations
- Excel/CSV parsing for custom LED coordinate mapping

## DDP Protocol Implementation (/server.js)
- Distributed Display Protocol frame management for LED control
- Protocol-specific packet formation:
  * Version flags: 0x01
  * RGB data type: 0x01
  * Output ID: 0x01
- LED addressing system with:
  * Maximum 480 LEDs per packet payload
  * Sequential LED offset management
  * Protocol-compliant byte offset calculations
- RGB buffer chunking into protocol packets
- LED positioning data stream management

Importance Score: 75/100
The LED mapping system provides critical functionality for translating virtual coordinates to physical LED positions and managing real-time control protocols for display output.
