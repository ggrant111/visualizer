# audio-visualization-algorithms

Core visualization algorithms in audioVisualizers.js implement specialized audio-reactive patterns:

## Visualization Algorithms

1. Shockwave Propagation
- Dynamic opacity calculation based on audio intensity
- Color blending with audio frequency bands
- Wave propagation patterns synchronized to audio peaks

2. Particle System
- Audio-reactive particle spawning mechanics
- Motion patterns driven by frequency analysis
- Dynamic particle properties tied to audio characteristics

3. Multi-Ring Pulse System
- Shape morphing based on frequency bands
- Concentric ring generation with audio mapping
- Synchronized pulse timing with beat detection

4. Hexagon Grid
- Audio intensity mapping to grid cells
- Real-time spectrum analysis visualization
- Intensity-based color and size modulation

## Audio Data Mapping

- Complex mapping of audio frequency data to visual parameters
- Real-time spectrum analysis translation to visual patterns
- Audio intensity thresholds for pattern triggering

Importance Score: 85/100

Key Implementation:
- Located in: /public/js/audioVisualizers.js
- Audio-visual synchronization logic
- Pattern generation algorithms
- Real-time rendering pipeline
