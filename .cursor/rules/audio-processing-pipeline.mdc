# audio-processing-pipeline

Audio processing functionality is implemented across three main components:

## Core Audio Analysis (/public/js/audioManager.js)
- Real-time audio capture pipeline from multiple input sources (microphone/screen)
- Frequency spectrum analysis with customizable frequency bands
- Audio intensity calculation algorithms
- Signal smoothing and sensitivity adjustment processing
Importance Score: 70/100

## Audio-Visual Mapping (/public/js/audioVisualizers.js)
- Audio frequency band mapping to visual parameters
- Complex waveform analysis for pattern generation
- Multi-channel audio data transformation for visualization layers:
  * Shockwave generation from frequency intensity
  * Particle emission rates based on audio peaks
  * Ring system modulation from frequency bands
  * Hexagon grid intensity mapping
Importance Score: 85/100

## Advanced Effect Processing (/public/js/butterchurnManager.js)
- Audio data transformation for shader-based visualizations
- Frequency spectrum integration with visual preset systems
- Dynamic audio parameter mapping for effect blending
Importance Score: 65/100

The pipeline processes audio through multiple stages:
1. Audio capture from selected input source
2. Real-time frequency analysis
3. Intensity calculation per frequency band
4. Data smoothing and sensitivity adjustments
5. Mapping of processed audio data to visual parameters
6. Integration with various visualization systems
